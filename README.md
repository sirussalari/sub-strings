# sub-strings

This project is an assignment as part of the Odin Project curriculum.

This is a simple program consisting of one function that takes two arguments. The first argument is supposed to be a string, and the second argument is supposed to be an array with substrings as elements.

The purpose and function of this program is to take a string(the first argument) and return the amount of instances that it finds a particular substring(second argument). This information is returned in a hash with the keys being the substrings that are contained in the substring array, and the values are the amount of times that that particular substring occurs in the full string.

The function can take multiple words with spaces and special characters as the string argument, and the second argument array can take any element that is any string.
